# Patent Pulse

## Description 

Your expiring patent search tool. I have had an interest in patents for a while now particularly in technologies that may soon become available to the public. When this happens there can be huge changes and advancements in certain industries. Some well know examples of this include 3D-Printing and Drones. I soon realised that it wasnt possible to search for expiring patents specifically through any of the online databases so this project is an attempt to provide a simple tool to do so. 


## Installation

No installation required. Just head over to the deployed app. Some upcoming features may require your API keys to function.


## Usage 
Visit the deployed app here: [Patent Pulse](https://korrin-f.github.io/expiring-patent-search/)
